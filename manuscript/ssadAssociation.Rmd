## Introduction

Species interactions are central to the evolution of biodiversity and the maintenance of that diversity in biological assemblages []. Not surprisingly, there is a rich research agenda in developing methods to quantify species interactions [].  Abundance or presence/absence data are among the most prevalent and accessible ecological data, and have consequentially been frequently leveraged [] to attempt to infer species interactions, beginning at least in the 1970s []. Two salient insights from decades of debate about inferring ecological processes from abundance/presence/absence data are: 1) interactions in the strict sense cannot be inferred, but *species associations* might be recoverable and these *associations* are assumed to map onto a combination of species-species or species-environment interactions []; 2) robust null models are necessary for any inference. Here I raise a new issue with null model approaches arising from the near universal [] spatial aggregation of individuals within species.  Spatial aggregation can arise from a large number of processes, both driven by deterministic mechanisms or complete demographic drift, thus aggregation in itself is not evidence of species association  The presence of spatial aggregation causes all currently employed null models to have overly high type I error rates, i.e., incorrectly detecting associations when there are none.

**Need to add something about the fact that major doubt has been cast on this approach, and yet people still do it**

### Association networks

**What do the people need to know?**

- people like making networks
- they do it in all kinds of fields
- the idea is that ++ is mutualism or shared niche, -- is comp or shared niche, and everything else +- +0 -0 00
- *note: maybe don't bother with non-symmetric? it's super hard regardless*
- *note: maybe make a figure for all this? maybe not worth it?*
- various metrics are used to calculate a number for the "strength" of the association (all basically correlation)
- but how do you tell if those associations are significant? --> null models


### Null models 

**What do the people need to know?**

- long ass debate about this, mostly about algorithms and how to add constraints
- constraints are important because null models need to capture realistic configurations
- however, even constraining marginals doesn't capture spatial aggregation due to demographic drift

### Spatial aggregation

**What do the people need to know?**

- it's pervasive
- it's neutral (or otherwise)
- it's negative binomial


Here I show how spatial aggregation obscures detection of species associations.  I do use using a combination of reanalysis of exemplar datasets from microbes to animals and plants, *in silico* experiments showing how spatial aggregation, driven solely by demographic drift, produces spurious association patterns, and a mathematical investigation of why this happens.


## Methods

### Reanalysis of exemplar datasets

I reanalyze several exemplar datasets previously used to infer species associations for two reasons: 1) to re-affirm the pervasiveness of negative binomial spatial aggregation within species; and 2) to show that these negative binomially distributed spatial abundance distributions are sufficient by themselves (i.e. with no *real* species associations) to reproduce published inferences of species associations.

The datasets used are:

**DS-1**: Calatayud, J., Andivia, E., Escudero, A., Meláin, C.J., Bernardo-Madrid,R., Stoffel, M.et al. (2020). Positive associations among rare species andtheir persistence in ecological assemblages.Nat. Ecol. Evol.,4,40–45.

**DS-2**: *ocean microbes*

**DS-3**: *soil microbes*
